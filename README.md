# Vargas-portfolio
*My actual portfolio assignment.*

# About Me
My name is Cindy Vargas and I am a 2nd yearr MSPPM student. I am happy to be nearing the end of my chapter at Heinz and look forward to potentially working with you all on a professional basis in the future. I am strongly looking into getting into consulting work. I learned from my project course ecperiences at Heinz, that I really enjoy the challenege of working with new teams and on a plethora of projects. I prefer taking on more project management roles and learning a little bit about everything versus being an expert on one subject matter. Plus, I find that fostering a strong sense of communicaton and transparency within a group makes it easier for teams to have cruical dialogue when challenges come up. I see it as my duty to ensure that a team can make it past these points of contention as smoothly as possible.

# What I Hope to Learn
I want to be exposed to different ways of visulaizing data thorugh a variety of mediums. It looks like I already got a headstart with this assignment. In expanding communication from teams to clients, I find that the righ visuals play a huge role in a team being able to sucessfully convey the efforts of their work and I want to learn how to take advantage of exisiting software that would help me help a team do just that. In this age of high level of information processed on a daily basis, getting the important aspects of work out to clients in a easy to understand fashion is imperative.
